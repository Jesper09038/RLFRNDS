Also config.py is NOT up-to-date

# RLFRNDS
RLFRNDS is an opensource and free to use platform on which you can add friends, see their status and invite them to play! 
# Explanation
I started this project out of frustration. As many others I use discord to communicate with friends and to see which friends are online. The problem with discord is that most of them are not comfortable with other people seeing their online status so they keep it on offline. The downside of this fenomenon is that it becomes harder to invite friends to play.

RLFRNDS is made to fix this problem. On RLFRNDS you are able to add friends, see their status and send them a message that invites them to play. you WONT be able to put your status on something different than online or offline.

0.6 september 7th 2024

- accidentally messed up the UI
- connected client to server with socketIO
- Devlog: Next up will be auto starting of the program, fixing the UI, making sure the client side has auto log in into the most recent account. after 0.7 (if I'm lucky) I will be able to launch 1.0!

note: didn't update the code again, I'll update it with 1.0. After 1.0 I might be done with this project anyway.
