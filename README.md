- ⚠️THIS PROJECT IS NOWHERE NEAR COMPLETED⚠️


# RLFRNDS
RLFRNDS is an opensource and free to use platform on which you can add friends, see their status and invite them to play! 
# Explanation
I started this project out of frustration. As many others I use discord to communicate with friends and to see which friends are online. The problem with discord is that most of them are not comfortable with other people seeing their online status so they keep it on offline. The downside of this fenomenon is that it becomes harder to invite friends to play.

RLFRNDS is made to fix this problem. On RLFRNDS you are able to add friends, see their status and send them a message that invites them to play. you WONT be able to put your status on something different than online or offline.

The garanteed featureslist: (✅ means its already implemented)
- ✅add friends
- remove friends
- see the status of friends
- invite friends
- settings (under which you can change your username and profile picture)
- ✅log out
- ✅log in
- ✅sign up

the program is currently a website but will be a .exe file when finished.
